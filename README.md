## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Online (Recommended)

Simply visit: **https://alankessler.github.io/toydiff/**

No installation, no setup, just open and use!

### Option 2: Run Locally

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. That's it - no build process or dependencies needed!

## Usage

### 1. Loading Your Lists

**Paste Text:**
- Type or paste items directly into either text area
- One item per line
- Empty lines are automatically ignored

**Upload Files:**
- Drag and drop a file onto the drop zone
- OR click the drop zone to browse and select a file
- Supported formats: `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.docx`

### 2. Choose Matching Algorithm

**Exact Match:**
- Finds only perfect matches
- Case sensitivity is optional (toggle "Ignore Case")
- Best for: Comparing identical lists

**Soundex (Phonetic):**
- Matches items that sound similar
- Great for finding name variations
- Example: "Smith" âŸ· "Smyth", "Jon" âŸ· "John"
- Best for: Names, words with common misspellings

**Levenshtein (Similarity):**
- Matches items based on edit distance
- Adjustable similarity threshold (50-100%)
- Shows similarity percentage for each match
- Example: "color" âŸ· "colour" (83% similar)
- Best for: Finding near-matches, typos, variations

### 3. Compare and View Results

Click **"Compare Lists"** to see:

- **Summary Cards:**
  - Number of matches found
  - Items only in List 1
  - Items only in List 2
  - Total items processed

- **Matches Tab:**
  - Paired items from both lists
  - Visual diff highlighting (yellow background)
  - Similarity percentage (for Levenshtein)

- **Only in List 1/2 Tabs:**
  - Items unique to each list
  - Easy to identify what's missing

## Examples

### Exact Matching

```
List 1: Apple, Banana, Cherry
List 2: Banana, Cherry, Date

Results:
âœ“ Matches: Banana, Cherry
â€¢ Only in List 1: Apple
â€¢ Only in List 2: Date
```

### Fuzzy Matching - Soundex

```
List 1: Smith, Jon, Robert
List 2: Smyth, John, Bob

Results with Soundex:
âœ“ Fuzzy Matches (differences highlighted):
  Smith âŸ· Smyth
  Jon âŸ· John

â€¢ Only in List 1: Robert
â€¢ Only in List 2: Bob
```

### Fuzzy Matching - Levenshtein (80% threshold)

```
List 1: color, favorite, organize
List 2: colour, favrite, organise

Results with Levenshtein:
âœ“ Fuzzy Matches (with similarity):
  color âŸ· colour (83.3%)
  favorite âŸ· favrite (87.5%)
  organize âŸ· organise (87.5%)
```
